3. Amount of Nodes
4. Neural Network to detect activities?
5. Choosen Example
6. Other looks into

## Feature Encoding

Try encoding features from gyroscope data:

- Angled
- Level
- Upside-down?

## Sampling Rate

Usage of Nyquist Frequency for the action.

## Amount of Nodes

Need more nodes

## Neural Network for activity detection

This would require a fixed interval of time for the input vector

## Choosen Example

Drinking water -> showcase turn around/behind wall and still recognize activity

## Other looks into

Movement patterns for activity recognitcion. Entry point review paper Kenan sent. Have not looked into yet.
